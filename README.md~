# Horiseon-refactor

## Description

For this project I reworked coding within the HTML document and the CSS stylesheet. Doing this allowed for the website to run using less code the achieve the same results. Thoughtout the HTML doc I removed div tags and replaced them with more modern semantic element tags, and added alt text to the images within the site. 

In the CSS styleshet I condensed and consolidated several classes and IDs with the attributes into one class, and changed some of them to element selectors. I then left comments throughout the stylesheed describing what each new class or element is doing for the code.

This website will remain functioning for any current or future Horiseon customers, allowing them to have a well organized website to access, while also bringing more functionality for visually impared viewers. This will also now make working on the website for future growth easier to access and navigate now that the websites semantic tags are updated.
